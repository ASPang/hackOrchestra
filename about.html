                 <p>Edwin Outwater  is Music Director of Ontario’s Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony (KWS), Director of Summer Concerts at the San Francisco  Symphony (SFS), and a regular guest conductor of the Chicago, San  Francisco and New World Symphonies. Equally adept at interpreting canonical  masterworks, premiering new commissions, and creating outside-the-box audience-building  initiatives the American conductor is, as <em>San Francisco Classical Voice</em> recently observed, “headed for a  top-tier future.” </p>
            <p>In  the 2014-15 season, his eighth as Music Director of the KWS, Outwater  leads the orchestra in a characteristically diverse array of programs. These include “The Mozart  Phenomenon”; a collaboration with Time for Three; a program focusing on Stravinsky  and another of works inspired by Shakespeare; music and comedy from composers  including Rossini and PDQ Bach; and works by contemporary Canadian composers. He  also continues the orchestra’s groundbreaking “Intersections” series of cross-cultural  and interdisciplinary collaborations. In 2011, Outwater directed the KWS in its  first commercial CD release in over a decade, <em>From Here On Out</em> on Analekta,  with music by Nico Muhly, Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood, and Arcade Fire’s  Richard Reed Parry, the last piece a KWS commission. This summer, in his  inaugural season as Director of Summer Concerts at the SFS, Outwater directed  jazz-inflected works by Bernstein, Gershwin, and Ravel; an all-Beethoven  program; and collaborations with pianist Makoto Ozone and Broadway star Cheyenne  Jackson, among others. His work with the SFS continues later this season when  Outwater conducts the orchestra’s New Year’s Eve Masquerade Ball and family  concerts, as well as collaborating with Nathaniel Stookey at the SFS’s new  alternative performance space, SoundBox. He also conducts the Milwaukee  Symphony, and returns to lead the Chicago Symphony and the BBC National  Orchestra of Wales. </p>
            <p>A native of Santa Monica, California, Edwin Outwater  attended Harvard University, graduating with a degree in English; he received  his master’s degree in conducting from UC Santa Barbara. Outwater was Resident  Conductor of the San Francisco Symphony from 2001-2006 where he worked closely  with Michael Tilson Thomas, toured with the orchestra, and conducted numerous  concerts. In 2004, his education programs at the San Francisco Symphony were  given the Leonard Bernstein Award for Excellence in Educational Programming and  his Chinese New Year Program was given the MET LIFE award for community  outreach. In the United States, Outwater has also conducted the New York and  Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestras, as well as the symphony orchestras of  Baltimore, Houston, Detroit, and Seattle, and the San Francisco and Cincinnati  Operas. In Canada, he has conducted the National Arts Centre Orchestra, as well  as the symphonies of Toronto, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, and Victoria.  International appearances include the Tokyo Metropolitan Orchestra, the BBC  National Orchestra of Wales, the New Zealand Symphony, the Adelaide Symphony,  the Malmö Symphony, the Nordwestdeutsche Philharmonie, the Mexico City  Philharmonic, the Orquesta Sinfónica de Xalapa, and the Hong Kong Sinfonietta.
