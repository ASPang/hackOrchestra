  <p>The 70th anniversary season begins with an astounding marathon of music as pianist Stewart Goodyear plays all five
Beethoven piano concertos with the KWS. This music is a joy to hear, and the immersive multi-night journey into Beethoven’s masterpieces for piano and orchestra will be unforgettable. (Piano Concerto No. 3 appears on the Matinée Series, September 26 at 2:30 pm.)

Pianist Orion Weiss returns to the KWS to perform one of Haydn’s greatest symphonies and one of Mozart’s most sublime piano concertos. Weiss will perform these pieces alongside delightful and surprising works both old and new.</p>

  <p>Members of the KWS take centre stage in a celebration of the remarkable individual talents that make up the Orchestra.
You’ll hear beautiful concerto performances from oboist James Mason, bassoonist Ian Hopkin, violist Natasha Sharko and concertmaster Bénédicte Lauzière. Then, the entire Orchestra takes a solo turn in Bartók’s masterpiece, Concerto for Orchestra.
<br><br>
      Bruckner’s epic Symphony No. 4 evokes ancient castles, hunting horns, snow-capped mountains and misty forests. It is one of the great romantic works for orchestra—majestic and transcendent. The music of Donovan Seidle opens the program, and Bruch’s famous violin concerto will be played by the fiery and expressive violinist Elena Urioste, making her KWS debut.</p>
